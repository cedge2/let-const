/* Quiz 
1. What is the difference between var and let? 
    you can both reassign and redeclare with var, but 
    you can't redeclare using let.  You can access a hoisted 
    variable with ver.  Let creates block scope.

2. What is the difference between var and const?
    You can reassign/redeclare var, but can't do 
    either with const.  You can access a hoisted
    variable with var. Const creates block scope.

3. What is the difference between let and const?
    You can reassign with let, but you can't redeclare or 
    reassign with const.

4. What is hoisting? 
    When variables are lifted or "hoisted" to the top of the 
    scope they are declared in.  When using var, you can access
    the variable name and it's undefined value before it is used
    later on.  Function declarations are also hoisted and can
    be invoked before they are defined in a codebase. */
